# Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction

This project is similar to a customer segmentation initiative i originally completed at **Astound Broadband** using public data. The goal was to segment customers into meaningful groups, predict churn risk, and derive actionable insights for marketing and retention strategies.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Replicate a real-world customer analytics project to demonstrate segmentation, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques.
- **Approach:**
  - Customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering** with **elbow optimization**.
  - Dimensionality reduction with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for visualization and feature simplification.
  - Predictive modeling using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** for churn classification.
  - Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Outcome:** Actionable insights into customer groups and churn drivers that can inform marketing campaigns, retention strategies, and resource allocation.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost  
- **Techniques:** Clustering, PCA, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Elbow Optimization, Model Evaluation

## Files
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb` – Main notebook with data preparation, clustering, modeling, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt` – List of required dependencies.

## Key Learnings
- How clustering techniques and elbow optimization can identify distinct customer segments.  
- Importance of dimensionality reduction for simplifying customer data without losing key patterns.  
- Practical application of supervised models for churn prediction.  
- End-to-end workflow from raw data preprocessing to business-focused insights.
